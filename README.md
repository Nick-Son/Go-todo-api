# RESTful JSON API

*Coded in Go*

A simple project to get familiar with building web servers in Go. More info to come...

*Note:*
As the project has been split into multiple files,  `go run main.go` will return a  `# command-line-arguments` error. To run the project, you need to build it into an executable by running:

```bash
go build
```

This will create a go script, which can be executed by running:

```bash
./*scriptname*
```
